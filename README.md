## Description

Note Taker is a web application that allows users to write and store notes.  The upper-right corner features a button that allows users to begin a new note.  Upon writing a title and body, a new button will appear allowing them to save the note.  That note will then appear in a list on the left side of the page.  These previously created notes may be viewed by clicking on them, or deleted by clicking on the red trashcan.
